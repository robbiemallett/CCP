# The CryoSat Community Processor

### Welcome

The CryoSat Community Processor is a project that offers a processor for CryoSat-2 data that anyone can use. The difference between this and other processors is that it is not just public, but also fully documented.

Community contributions are not just accepted, but encouraged. However all contributions must be fully documented using docstrings and a detailed pull request. Published code is not useful unless it can be used!
